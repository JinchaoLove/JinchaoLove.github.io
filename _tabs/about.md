## Short Bio

I am a final-year Ph.D. student at the [Human-Computer Communications Laboratory][hccl] (HCCL) in [The Chinese University of Hong Kong][cuhk], advised by Prof. [Helen Meng][helen].
Before that, I obtained my B.S. with honors from [Nanjing University][nju] in 2019.
My research interests encompass **multimodal AI (speech, language, vision) for social good (e.g., healthcare)**, such as:

- Neurocognitive Disorder Recognition
- Multimodal Emotion Recognition
- Multimodal Large Language Models
